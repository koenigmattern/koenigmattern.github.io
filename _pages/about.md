I am a PhD student in the Process Systems Engineering group of Prof. Kai Sundmacher at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems in Magdeburg. 
Here, I develop biorefinery processes for lignocellulose and algal biomass. I was a guest PhD student at the Laboratory of Sustainable and Catalytic Processing led by Prof. Jeremy Luterbacher at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland to learn about lignocellulose fractionation.
My work lies at the nexus of computational and experimental work. In the past years, I gathered expertise in high-throughput solvent selection and computer-aided molecular design. 


Upcoming talks
======
I'll be giving a keynote lecture about "Tailored solvent design for lignin dissolution using graph neural networks" at ECCE/ECAB in Berlin!
Join the Biorefinery session on Monday, Sept 18, 11:00 a.m. Looking forward to chat with you!
